**Disclaimer for Petals - Decentralized Text Generation Tool**

Welcome to Petals, the decentralized text generation tool. Before you proceed, please take a moment to read and understand the following disclaimer:

1. **Decentralized Network**: Petals operates on a decentralized network, which means that text generation tasks are distributed across a vast network of nodes, each independently operated. These nodes may include individuals from various backgrounds, and their identities may remain anonymous.

2. **Data Access**: When you use Petals, your prompts and the generated text may be processed and stored on multiple nodes within the network. This distributed nature of data handling means that your input and output may be accessible to multiple participants in the network.

3. **Anonymous Hosts**: It's important to note that many nodes within the Petals network are hosted by anonymous individuals or entities. These hosts may not be subject to the same data protection regulations as centralized services, and their motivations for participating in the network can vary widely.

4. **Security Considerations**: While we take security precautions seriously, the decentralized nature of Petals means that we cannot provide the same level of data security and privacy assurances as centralized services. Therefore, please exercise caution when using Petals for sensitive or confidential information.

5. **Use at Your Discretion**: By using Petals, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with decentralized networks, including potential exposure of your prompts and generated text. You are solely responsible for the content you input and generate using this platform.

6. **No Liability**: The creators and operators of Petals shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or issues arising from your use of the platform, including any exposure of your data to the decentralized network.

7. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that your use of Petals complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, including data protection and privacy laws.

By proceeding to use Petals, you agree to abide by this disclaimer and acknowledge that you have read and understood the associated risks. If you do not agree with these terms or have concerns about the privacy and security implications, we advise against using Petals for your text generation needs.

Please use Petals responsibly and exercise discretion when sharing sensitive information or prompts on this platform. Your privacy and data security are important to us, but they may be subject to different considerations within a decentralized network.
